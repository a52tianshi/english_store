The last vacation she took was more than two years ago.

Christina hasn't see her friend for a long time.
The last time they saw each other was three years ago.
At that time, they were both working at a department store.
Then Christina quit her job and started her ouw business.
She designs women's clothing.

Christina has come to San Francisco by herself.
Her husband didn't come because he has to work.
He tried to start a company two years ago, but it didn't work out.
His company failed after only a few months.
So now he's working at another company and saving money.
Once he saves enough money, he plans to start another company.
He doesn't want to give up.

The first time was when she was a high school student.
That was more than ten years ago.
During that trip she was only in San Francisco for a few days.
After that she went to Los Angeles and New York.
This time she and her friend plan to relax and have fun.
